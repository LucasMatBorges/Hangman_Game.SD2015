# Hangman Game in Python

This is a simple Hangman game in Python that uses the Turtle library to create a graphical interface. The player tries to guess a randomly chosen word from the `entrada.txt` file before making six errors.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Turtle library (usually included in the standard Python installation)
- An `entrada.txt` file containing words for the game (one word per line)

## How to Play
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Make sure the `entrada.txt` file contains a list of words for the game (one word per line).
3. Run the `hangman_game.py` file in Python.
4. A window will open, displaying the hangman game.
5. The player can input letters to guess the word.
6. If the letter is correct, it will be filled in the word. Otherwise, a hangman element will be drawn.
7. The player has six attempts to guess the word, or the hangman will be completed, resulting in a loss.
